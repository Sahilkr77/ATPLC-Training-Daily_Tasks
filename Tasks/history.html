    <h1>history:-</h1>
    <p id="r"> District, ‘The Land Of Leechi’ was created in 1875 for the sake of administrative
        convenience by splitting up the earlier district of Tirhut. The present district of Muzaffarpur
        came to its existence in the 18th century and named after Muzaffar Khan, an Amil (Revenue Officer)
        under British Dynasty. Purbi Champaran and Sitamarhi districts on North, on the South Vaishali and
        Saran districts, on the East Darbhanga and Samastipur districts and on the West Saran and Gopalganj
        districts surround Muzaffarpur. Now it has won international encomiums for its delicious Shahi
        Leechi and China Leechi.

        It is, of course impossible to trace back the history of this region to its earliest
        origins, but we can trace back it’s stream of strong heritage a very long way through
        the ancient Indian epic Ramayan, which still bears a significant role in Indian civilization.
        To initiate with the Legend, Rajarshi Janak was ruling Videha, the mythological
        name of this entire region including eastern Nepal and northern Bihar. Sitamarhi,
        a place in this region, bears a value of sacred Hindu belief where, Seeta
        (other name Vaidehi: The Princes of Videha) sprang to life out of an earthen pot
        while Rajarshi Janak was tilling the land.

        The recorded history of the district dates back to the rise of the Vrijjan Republic.
        The center of political power also shifted from Mithila to Vaishali. The Vrijjan
        Republic was a confederation of eight clans of which the Licchavis were the most
        powerful and influential. Even the powerful kingdom of Magadh had to conclude
        matrimonial alliances in 519 B.C. with the neighboring estates of the Licchavis.
        Ajatshatru invaded Vaishali and extended his sway over Tirhut. It was at this
        time that Patliputra (the modern Patna) was founded at the village Patali on
        the banks of the sacred river Ganga and Ajatshatru built an invincible
        fortress to keep vigil over the Licchavis on the other side of the river.
        Ambarati, 40 Kms from Muzaffarpur is believed to be the village home of
        Amrapali, the famous Royal court dancer of Vaishali.

        Vaishali, a center of religious renaissance, Baso Kund, the birth place of Mahavir,
        the 24th Jain Tirthankar and a contemporary of Lord Buddha continue to attract
        visitors from across the international boarders.
