        Muzaffarpur (pronunciation (helpÂ·info)) is a city located in Muzaffarpur district
        in the Tirhut region of the Indian state of Bihar.[5][1] It serves as the headquarters
        of the Tirhut division, the Muzaffarpur district and the Muzaffarpur Railway District.
        It is the fourth most populous city in Bihar.

        Muzaffarpur is famous for Shahi lychees and is known as the Lychee Kingdom.[6][7] Shahi litchi
        is set to become the fourth product from Bihar, after jardalu mango, katarni rice and Magahi
        paan (betel leaf) to get the Geographical Indication (GI) tag. It is situated on the banks of
        the perennial Budhi Gandak River, which flows from the Someshwar Hills[8] of the Himalayas.

        The current city was established in 1875 during the British Raj for administrative convenience,
        by dividing the Tirhut district and was named after an aumil, Muzaffar Khan; thus the city came
        to be known as Muzaffarpur.[9]
